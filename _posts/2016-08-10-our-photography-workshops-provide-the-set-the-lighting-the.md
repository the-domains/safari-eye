  Our photography workshops provide the set, the lighting, the models, the
  product, and all you have to do is turn up with your camera and shoot! You can
  literally walk into a mock-commercial scenario where YOU are in charge of
  photography. Imagination abounds – perhaps a roaring 20’s Great Gatsby theme,
  or an exotic tropical island shoot, or maybe something more adventurous like
  letting us bring the wild heart of Africa to you!You bring your camera and
  materials, and we do the rest. It’s that easy. Our workshops also invite an
  industry professional guest - it may be a stylist to share some handy tips, or
  might be a director or industry photographer to pass on their knowledge – each
  workshop is different. SafariEye caters for beginners through to the more
  accomplished photographer, basically anyone with a passion for taking
  pictures!Come and experiment with your creativity, make a mock-ad, meet new
  people and network, challenge yourself, learn, laugh, get inspired, explore
  new ideas in a supportive environment - all whilst having HEAPS of fun!
